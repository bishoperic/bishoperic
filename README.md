# About Me

Hey there!

I'm Eric Bishop, web developer, occasional UI/UX designer, and fan of elegant solutions to interesting problems. I'm often thinking about how things work, and what lessons can be learned and applied from understanding systems to iterate on them and change them for the better.

## Projects

- [Game Timer](https://boardgame-timer.vercel.app) \[[+repo](https://github.com/bishoperic/game-timer)\]: I built a web app to help keep board games from taking too much time; once you enter the realm of 6-hour games, speeding up slower players is much appreciated by everyone else. I built it using [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit), which is probably a little overkill, but I think Svelte's pretty nice. Features include:

  - A sleek and useable design
  - Use of LocalStorage to keep your settings between sessions
  - Responsive design, will look good from mobile to desktop

- [Fractal Clock](https://fractal-clock.vercel.app) \[[+repo](https://github.com/bishoperic/fractal-clock)\]: A project just for fun, I decided to make my own version of a fractal clock that I saw in a YouTube video using [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/). Turned out pretty cool.
